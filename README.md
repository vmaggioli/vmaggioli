# Vincent Maggioli -- @vmaggioli
Hey, I'm Vince - a DevOps engineer for Philips EMR working to support development on our healthcare platform.

## 🤵 Who am I?
#### 🧠 - an active learner
My degree specification is in general Software Engineering, but I've been actively learning principles in DevOps on the job as well as becoming versed in Machine Learning through [certifications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-maggioli/).

#### 🎮 - a huge gamer
I got my first console in high school (Xbox 360), and it's been game over ever since. A few of my highest hours played games are; LoL, Final Fantasy XIV, Monster Hunter: World, and CS:GO. My current go-to games are Final Fantasy 14 and [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu).

#### ⌨️ - a keyboard nerd
A new hobby I've found after college is creating mechanical keyboards! I've currently only built 2 (speed silver and zilent v2 switches), but I've got plans for many more.

## 🌟 Goals for 2020
My main goals for 2020 are rooted in certifications, as I want to be AWS Developer Certified as well as be on the path to gaining a Tensorflow certification next year. I also would like to begin contributing to [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) since it's a game that I thoroughly enjoy.
