# Vincent Maggioli -- @vmaggioli
Hey, I'm Vince - a Senior Software Engineer for Capital One!

## 🤵 Who am I?
### 🧠 - an active learner
My degree specification is in general Software Engineering, but I've been actively learning and utilizing technologies such as AWS, Kubernetes and Helm.

### 🎮 - a huge gamer
I got my first console in high school (Xbox 360), and it's been game over ever since. A few of my highest hours played games are; League of Legends, Final Fantasy XIV, Monster Hunter: World, and CS:GO. My current go-to game is Final Fantasy XIV.

### ⌨️ - a keyboard nerd
A new hobby I've found after college is creating mechanical keyboards! I've currently only built 3 (speed silver, zilent v2, and kalih box jade switche), but I've got plans for many more.
